# 16S_analysis_pipeline

Building a pipeline for automated 16S analysis from paired short-reads or long-reads

Please read on *Wikipedia* about the ribosoma RNA complex [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_RNA) and about metagenomics [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics)

The impact on the choice of primer for amplicon sequencing to perform 16S metagenomics analysis of complex populations is discussed in [Johnson et al 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13036-1)
